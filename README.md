# porkbrain.com

Personal website.

## CI/CD
The deployment is still WIP.

`docker build --tag porkbrain-builder .`

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v "${PWD}":/porkbrain \
    -v /tmp/porkbrain:/ssh_keys \
    -w "/porkbrain" \
    --name "porkbrain-builder" \
    porkbrain-builder /bin/bash
```

```
./prod.sh --pem "/ssh_keys/porkbrain-server.pem" \
    -i "ec2-user@ec2-1-2-3-4.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
```

```
docker exec bin/porkbrain rpc "Elixir.Porkbrain.ReleaseTasks.migrate"
```

## Running in docker
We're using [this guide][docker-with-phoenix] to set up a testing environment in
which our Phoenix app talks to Docker.

Use `docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit` to create the container. Tests
can be run in the container with `docker-compose run porkbrain mix test`.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## New database table
To set up new database table, refer to [this Ecto tutorial][ecto-new-table]. For
list of database fields refer to the [documentation here][ecto-types]. The
primary key column named `id` is created by default.

## Postgres
You can list all databases with `\l`. Then connect to a database with
`\c {db_name}`. To list database tables use `\dt`. `\d+ {table_name}` prints the
structure of a table.

To take a backup into an SQL file, use
`pg_dump -U porkbrain -W --column-inserts porkbrain > porkbrain_dump.sql`.

## Markdown
Markdown [engine][md-engine] is added, therefore pages can be written in MD if
they have suffix `html.md`.
